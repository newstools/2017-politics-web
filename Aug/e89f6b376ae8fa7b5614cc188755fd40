THE ANCWL STATEMENT CONDEMNING ALLEGED ACTS OF ILL- DISCIPLINE BY CDE ANGIE MOTSHEKGA 26 August 2017 The leadership of the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) has received reports alleging that Cde Angie Motshekga is organising various events around the country under the banner of the ANCWL. In order to maintain unity within the organisation, the democratically elected leadership of the ANCWL under President Cde Bathabile Dlamini will nip in the bud any signs of ill-discipline rearing it's ugly head in the organisation. Cde Angie is an NEC member of the ANC who is not serving in any leadership structure of the ANCWL. She is a Cabinet Minister responsible for Basic Education with no mandate from the  ANCWL to organise any event around the country under the banner of the ANCWL. Cde Angie must accept that a duly constituted conference of the ANCWL did not vote for her to continue in the leadership helm of the organisation. She must allow herself to be led and desist from trying to rule the ANCWL from the grave. She is given space to lead Ministry of Education, the ANCWL calls Cde Angie to give space to the current ANCWL leadership to lead the organisation. She has the right to canvass for her preferred ANC Presidential candidate but organising events around the country under the banner of ANCWL whilst  not  leading  in any ANCWL structure is high level of ill-discipline and a sign of not accepting to be led. The ANCWL under Cde Bathabile Dlamini and the collective works tirelessly to build effective structures in unifying the organisation. We will not take it kindly if Cde Angie or any of ANCWL member or supporter undermines unity of the organisation. A united ANCWL is for the benefit of women of South Africa.
