ANC must appear before Moerane Commission to explain the political killings 28 August 2017 Today, the Democratic Alliance appeared before the Moerane Commission of inquiry into political killings in KwaZulu-Natal to present evidence. During the hearings, the DA made a presentation about murder, assassinations and corruption which has taken root in far too many municipalities, like Richmond, all under the ANC's watch and without repercussions. To date, not a single person has been arrested or questioned in the four politically motivated deaths in this town. This, however, is a microcosm of what is going on in KwaZulu Natal. It is clear that the more the ANC tears into itself in an effort to gain access to state resources and to ensure that those who fight corruption are kept silent, the more the ordinary citizens of KZN will suffer. That's why we challenge the ANC to appear before the Commission to explain why this situation of murder, corruption and non-accountability has grown under their watch. It is impossible that those in senior ANC positions do not have knowledge of the killings that have taken place and that's why it's important they reveal all under oath. Their continued silence will be a tacit admission of wrong doing. Issued by Dean Macpherson, DA uMgungundlovu East Constituency Head, 28 August 2017
