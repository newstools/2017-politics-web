ANCYL shocked at billions wasted at Treasury&nbsp;30 August 2017 ANCYL is alarmed at The Standing Committee on Public Accounts proceedings on the National Treasury on losing billions in IFMS programme that never took off the ground.&nbsp; We further note that Scopa called on Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to take decisive action against officials responsible for the collapse of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) wasting over R1 billion in the first phase.&nbsp; National Treasury is watchdog for spendings in all the national departments and the fact that taxpayer&rsquo;s billions were wasted within treasury is a matter of grave concern. We further request SCOPA to include then Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, his deputy and DG to further elaborate on these financial irregularities and mismanagement.&nbsp; We demand forensic investigation so that responsibility can be assigned and strictest action should be taken so that it&rsquo;s not repeated again. People&rsquo;s faith in National Treasury can be rebuilt if strictest action is taken against those involved and full report is made public on the findings.
