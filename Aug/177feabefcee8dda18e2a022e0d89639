SAPS must urgently investigate pregnancies at Bothithong High School31 August 2017The Democratic Alliance in the Northern Cape is outraged by the recent crisis at the Bothithong High School in John Taolo Gaetsewe, where approximately 30 learners are allegedly pregnant.Allegations that educators have impregnated these girls, and have offered the girls money, must be investigated swiftly by both the South African Police Services and the provincial department of education.We welcome the resignation of the one educator, who has reportedly admitted to impregnating at least three pupils. We view this resignation and his admission as very strong grounds for criminal charges of sexual assault to be brought. We trust that he will not be redeployed to another school and we urge the provincial department to rid the school of any person who preys on our girls.There is no place in our schools for any educator who abuses their position of authority and forces learners into sexual relationships.The crisis highlights, once again, that the provincial department of education needs to do more now to address teenage pregnancy in our schools. During 2016, more than 150 learners fell pregnant in the Northern Cape. When we raised these concerns during the budget debate, Education MEC, Martha Bartlett was quick to shrug off responsibility.We will be holding her and her department to account to ensure that there is a thorough investigation, with the immediate implementation of consequences for those who abuse our children.Issued by&nbsp;Safiyia Stanfley,&nbsp;DA Provincial Spokesperson on Education in the Northern Cape, 31 August 2017&nbsp;
