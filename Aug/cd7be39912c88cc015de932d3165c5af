THE EFF CONGRATULATES COMMISSAR DOCTOR MBUYISENI NDLOZI FOR ACQUIRING THE DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE-POLITICAL STUDIES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND JOHANNESBURG Saturday, August 19, 2017 The Economic Freedom Fighters congratulates Commissar Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi for being awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Political Studies by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. On Friday, the 18th of August 2017, Wits University officially communicated to Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi that he is awarded the degree. The EFF is proud of his achievements and cherish the discipline, dedication, focus and passion through which he mastered political activism and doctoral studies. As a Central Command Team member, National Spokesperson and Ground Force of the EFF, Commissar Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi never compromised his work despite the fact that he was busy finishing his studies. Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi is amongst the most dedicated, committed and impactful leaders of the EFF. The EFF is alsoÂ proud that he has achieved a doctorate before the age of 35. All Activists of the EFF should take inspiration from Commissar Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and pursue their studies until the highest level of qualifications. The EFF ascribes to Che Guevara's clarion call that the first task of a revolutionary is to be educated. We also are inspired by Thomas Sankara's correct observation that a soldier without proper ideological and political training is a potential criminal. We are therefore confident that in Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, the EFF is mounding and producing one of the best leaders of society. Well done Commissar Dr. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Your success must inspire many others. Statement issued by Julius Sello Malema, Commander in Chief and President of the Economic Freedom Fighters, 21 August 2017
