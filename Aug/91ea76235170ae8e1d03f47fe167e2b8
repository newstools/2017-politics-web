Minister Lindiwe Zulu distances herself from newspaper reports on rape allegations 28 August 2017 Minister of Small Business Development, Ms Lindiwe Zulu, is disappointed by newspaper reports that drag her name into a story about a man accused of raping a 25-year-old Free State student. This story has absolutely nothing to do with Minister Zulu. City Press mentions Minister Zulu as a close friend of the man involved in the alleged rape. It is obvious that the intention of the newspaper was to cast aspersions on the integrity of Minister Zulu generally, as well as on her commitment to women’s rights, in particular. Minister Zulu’s record as a gender activist and passionate advocate for women’s rights speaks for itself. Minister Zulu has never, and will never support any kind of abuse against women. In this particular case, Minister Zulu has confidence in the country’s law enforcement agencies and our justice system to handle this matter appropriately. The law must be allowed to take its course.
