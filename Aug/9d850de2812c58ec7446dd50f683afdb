38 'coloured' schools closed in Gauteng over black principal appointmentJohannesburg &ndash; Teaching at an estimated 38 &ldquo;coloured&rdquo; schools in Gauteng was disrupted on Monday when teachers embarked on a go-slow in solidarity with a Klipspruit school, a spokesperson said. &ldquo;The department will have a clear picture about the number of affected schools by tomorrow [Tuesday] morning, but we estimate up to 38 schools are affected,&rdquo; Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona told News24 on Monday afternoon. He said the department condemns the go-slow and all the concerned parties are working tirelessly to resolve the deadlock. Protest action started at the Klipspruit-West Secondary School in Soweto last week Monday when parents called for the removal of a newly appointed black principal. At the time, Patriotic Association of South Africa (Pasa) spokesperson Charis Pretorius said parents were frustrated over a black principal which was irregularly appointed by the department. She denied that the protest was racially motivated. "We are a majority coloured community. Then they appoint people to a selection committee who are illegitimate and create a shortlist where only one of the six candidates is coloured &ndash; when 11 coloured candidates applied,&rdquo; Pretorius said. "Why wasn&rsquo;t the current caretaker even considered?" According to its website, Pasa is a political party formed for marginalised people such as coloureds, the Khoi San, and Indians. News24
