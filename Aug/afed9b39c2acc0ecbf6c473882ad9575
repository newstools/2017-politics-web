Media Statement on skinny pants protest at Hoёrskool Pretoria West 28 August 2017 The Gauteng Department of Education confirms that learning and teaching at Hoёrskool Pretoria Wes, has this morning, 28 August 2017, resumed as per normal. This follows the disruption of learning and teaching on Friday, 25 August 2017, where learners, demanded the incorporation of skinny pants into school uniform. Officials dispatched to the school this morning confirmed that the protest emanated from two unruly learners who transgressed the code of conduct regarding uniform. Following a disciplinary process, the learners received a sanction of a 7-day suspension. Their 7 days lapsed on Thursday, wherein they began to coerce other learners to force the school to allow them to wear skinny pants; hence, the said disruption on Friday. However, it is encouraging, that the grade 12 learners were allowed to write their pre-trial examination. The two learners also created a peer group on WhatsApp, which excluded the RCL, who have since joined to monitor the group. The SGB has decided to call a parents meeting to discuss the matter further and in the interim, the school code of conduct remains in place. However, no learner must be denied access to education. The department condemns the action of the learners in the strongest terms and urges all learners to use available structures at all times, to raise issues of concern, and not resort to disrupting school. We appeal to leaners to refrain from illegal protests and other such activities, as their future depends on education. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said, “It is unfortunate and disappointing, that we are distracted by what we regard as petty issues, which should not be our priority. Our focus is on enhancing the quality of education, which is performance driven, we are preoccupied by pre-trial examinations and preparations for final examinations.” Issued by Oupa Bodibe, Gauteng Department of Education's Acting Head of Communications, 28 August 2017
