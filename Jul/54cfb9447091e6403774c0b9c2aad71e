THE&nbsp;ANCWL&nbsp;STATEMENT ON THE ALLEGED SEXUAL &nbsp;HARASSMENT REPORTS AGAINST THE GUPTA BROTHERS&nbsp; 7 July 2017 The African National Congress (ANCWL) has noted reports on TIMESLIVE &nbsp;that "three women have spoken out on their experiences or knowledge about the alleged sexual harassment whilst working for the Gupta brothers" &nbsp; Even though the reports are unverified at this stage, the&nbsp;ANCWL&nbsp;has always been firm that it stands with the victims of violence and sexual abuse and would like to reiterate this position. The&nbsp;ANCWL&nbsp;calls on society to report all violence and sexual abuse acts to the law enforcement agencies for the law to take its course. We firmly believe in the principles of the freedom charter, which state that all shall be equal before the law and hopes for a fair and just trial as no one is above the law.&nbsp; The&nbsp;ANCWL&nbsp;further appeals to all members of society to unashamedly stand up against violence and sexual abuse and also support the victims of sexual abuse. We also take into account and acknowledge the principles of innocent until proven guilty. Statement issued by Meokgo Matuba, ANCWL&nbsp;Secretary General 9 July 2017
