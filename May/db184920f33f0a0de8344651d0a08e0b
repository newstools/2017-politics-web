HUNDREDS OF NPO EMPLOYED SOCIAL WORKERS FACE JOB LOSSESThe Department of Social Development in the Eastern Cape has embarked on a quiet and selective mission to identify and cut various non-profit organisation's budget funding allocations overnight by 50%. This uncaring act administered by MEC Nancy Sihlwayi of Social Development and her department officials has triggered a state of panic amongst hundreds of NPO&rsquo;s that are employing experienced social workers as they have to be retrenched. The restructuring and possible closure of affected NPO&rsquo;s will have a negative effect on thousands of vulnerable adults and children as they will be receiving limited or inadequate social services. I have written to the Chairperson of the Social Development portfolio committee in Bhisho, Christian Martin, requesting reasons why this decision by the department was not brought to our attention as a committee. Please click&nbsp;here &nbsp;to view the letter. This action by the department is in my opinion irresponsible, uncaring, unlawful, unreasonable and procedurally unfair. The portfolio committee should be convened as a matter of urgency and the officials called to account and show some teeth in fighting for the poor.
