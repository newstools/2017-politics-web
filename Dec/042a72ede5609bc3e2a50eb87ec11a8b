ANC KZN to appeal judgment against its Provincial Executive Committee 15 December 2017 The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has noted the judgement handed down by the Pietermaritzburg High Court earlier today. The ANC expresses its deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the ruling as its implications have huge ramifications for the ANC Constitution and the functionality of the organisation in its entirety. The PEC welcomes the decision of the High Court to grant it a leave to appeal the judgment in the Supreme Court of Appeal which has been urgently implemented following the judgment. The declaratory order to execute the September 2017 High Court judgment is now left to the Supreme Court of Appeal since it is an automatic appeal for the PEC. It is the view of the ANC in KZN that, if left unchallenged, today’s ruling will create a chaotic precedent that could paralyse the democratic processes within the organisation in the future. The movement is also of the firm view that this judgement lacks in rationality hence the PEC has resolved to institute an urgent appeal against it. The ANCKZN is more than ready to actively participate in the upcoming 54th National Conference and its positions and perspectives remain solid. The ANCKZN is urging all delegates to remain focused, united, disciplined and not become side-tracked by sideshows, especially in this ‘juristo-crazy’ season. The ANCKZN is ready to make history at the party’s 54th National Conference by adopting policies and electing leadership that will advance radical economic transformation, unite the organisation and ensure economic emancipation of the masses in our lifetime. We are ready, united and facing one direction. Issued by Mdumiseni Ntuli, Provincial Spokesperson, ANC KZN, 15 December 2017
