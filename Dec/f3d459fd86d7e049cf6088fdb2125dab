The Hawks must do what Lynne Brown has failed to do and hold Koko accountable Today the Democratic Alliance filed criminal charges against the newly reinstated Eskom CEO, Matshela Koko. Follow the sham of a disciplinary hearing, clearing Koko of all charges relating to misconduct, we have laid charges in terms of the Public Finance Management Finance Act (PFMA) as we believe Koko may have used his position at Eskom to improperly benefit his step-daughter's company and her, which, if true, is a violation of the PFMA. Earlier this year it came to light that Koko allegedly awarded lucrative Eskom contracts, worth R1 billion, to Impulse International, a company linked to his stepdaughter. He was also apparently involved in approving an R650 million loan from Eskom to Gupta-linked Tegeta, in order to ensure that the Guptas purchased Optimum. Since Eskom and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, are incapable of holding the seemingly captured and heavily implicated Koko to account, it is up to the Hawks to investigate the matter and to take action should the investigation find evidence of wrongdoing.
