Results Of The Municipal By-Elections Held On 29 November 2017 The Electoral Commission has finalised the results of by-elections held on 29 November 2017 in the Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape after convening last night to consider a number of issues and objections raised by parties. The objections in Metsimaholo included that some voters in one voting district in ward 1 had erroneously been provided with ballot papers from a different ward (ward 19). When the matter came to the attention of the Commission on election day, the ballot boxes affected were immediately sealed and quarantined and the correct ballot was then used for the remainder of the day using different ballot boxes. At a meeting last night the Commission resolved that the quarantined ballot boxes should be opened in the presence of party agents and all valid ballots extracted – including all PR ballots (which were not affected as the PR ballots are uniform for the entire municipality) and correctly issued ward 1 ballots. The remaining incorrectly issued ballots for Ward 19 – numbering about 200 – were re-quarantined and excluded from the count. The decision of the Commission was communicated to all parties at a meeting of the Municipal Party Liaison Committee  today whereafter the quarantined ballot boxes were opened and the valid ballots extracted and counted. The final results for the by-elections are as follows: Eastern Cape – EC 155 Nyandeni: The African National Congress retained ward 32 which it won in the 2016 Municipal Elections, but with a decreased margin of 68.24% of the votes compared to 83.09% in 2016.
