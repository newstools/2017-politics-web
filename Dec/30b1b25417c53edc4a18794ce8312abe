AfriForum welcomes Nersa’s decision about tariff increase 15 December 2017   The civil rights organisation AfriForum welcomes the decision by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to increase Eskom’s electricity tariff for the 2018/2019 financial year with only 5,23%. This follows after Eskom applied for an increase of 19,9%. “AfriForum opposed this tariff increase from the very beginning by delivering written commentary to Nersa. We also participated in the public participation process by delivering a presentation which argues that the costs of Eskom’s alleged corrupt activities and maladministration must be excluded from the calculation of the increase for the coming year’s electricity tariff,” says Morné Mostert, AfriForum’s Head of Local Government Affairs.  During this participation process, businesses, mines and other organisations explained their perspective with regards to why the increase should not take place. The number of objections submitted were so overwhelming that the energy regulator twice had to postpone the announcement of its decision. “Communities can no longer pay for Eskom’s maladministration and it is time that they are held accountable for it. Communities can help to offer solutions for the country’s problems by participating in public processes and joining civil rights organisations opposing such injustice. We will study the reasons for Nersa’s decision in depth,” concludes Mostert. With your support AfriForum can continue to fight for your rights.
