SCOPA appreciates social grants deal between SAPO and SASSA 11 December 2017 The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) appreciates the deal struck between the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and the South African Post Office (Sapo), which brings to an end the uncertainty and anxiety of grant recipients and the nation at large. The Committee condemns SASSA’s incompetence and obfuscation in this matter, and notes that time is short. This means that the Post Office must work hard and quickly to ensure that there is a seamless transition, so that grant recipients receive their grants on time in 2018. Scopa feels vindicated that its relentless persistence has finally yielded a positive outcome. The grant distribution debacle must be a lesson to all departments and cabinet ministers that they cannot avoid accountability. This episode has once again proved that Parliament can achieve good results for all South Africans. The Chairperson of Scopa, Mr Themba Godi, would like to thank members of Scopa and the Portfolio Committee on Social Development, the public and the media for their support and encouragement. Members of the Committee are looking forward to engaging with the Inter-Ministerial Committee in January 2018 on the substance of the agreement and the implementation milestones thus far. Scopa remains committed to holding to account all departments and entities on the management of public funds. The Committee promises to be relentless and determined in its work in 2018.
