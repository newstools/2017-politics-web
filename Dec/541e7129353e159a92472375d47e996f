Defauling Municipalites to face water restrictions 15 December 2017 The Minster of Water and Sanitation (DWS) Ms Nomvula Mokonyane, updated members of the media on the progress towards recovering the R10.7 billion debt for bulk water services owed by municipalities to the department and water boards. The department is encouraged by the positive response by 25 of the 30 most indebted municipalities to the call by the DWS to engage and propose acceptable repayment plans. Five municipalities were announced to face water restrictions and includes Ngaka Modiri Molema, Msukaligwa, Madibeng, Mafube and Maluti-a-Phofung municipalities. The water restrictions will be implemented starting with a minimum of 20% reductions to the defaulting municipalities until payment arrangements are made with the department and the Water Boards or otherwise increasing incrementally. To date, a total of R213 million has been paid by municipalities to the Water Boards and R55,5 million to the Water Trading Entity of the Department of Water and Sanitation. Commitments received since the initial pronouncements and over and above monies already received, amount to R300 million. The Department would like to encourage all the municipalities that have outstanding debts due to the department to make payments as soon as possible to avoid the escalation. This is with the understanding that more municipalities have outstanding debts outside the 30 municipalities which were issued with notices late last month. We would like to reiterate that the payment of water services will go a long way in addressing the water challenges facing the country.
