Minister Motsoaledi must clarify placements of medical students The DA calls on the Health Minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, to provide adequate clarity regarding the placement of medical students in public hospitals in order to gain the requisite practical experience. The DA notes with great concern the various media reports highlighting the anxiety of medical students who are yet to be placed to complete their compulsory medical internships. These graduates are compelled to complete a two-year supervised medical internship in the public sector. The National Department of Health has a responsibility to ensure the placement of medical graduates in various public hospitals. Since this is a national competence, both Minister Motsoaledi and his Department will have to be held accountable if all eligible graduates don’t find placement in the public health system by 1 January 2018. It is necessary for the Minister Motsoaledi to urgently intervene and aptly address these concerns, as this could possibly have dire consequences for these medical students. The DA therefore calls on Minister Motsoaledi to provide certainty pertaining to the placement of medical students. If it is in fact true that these students have not been placed due to errors in the online system, it is critical that their fears are quelled and that they are reassured about their 2018 placements. The National Department of Health cannot stay quiet while the medical futures of these students hang in the balance. The DA will continue mounting pressure on Minister Motsoaledi to act decisively and give this urgent matter the attention it rightfully deserves.
