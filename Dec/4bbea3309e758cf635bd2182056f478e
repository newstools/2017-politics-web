EFF WELCOMES ZUMA'S APPEAL OF STATE CAPTURE JUDGEMENT AS LONG AS HE PAYS PERSONALLY Friday, December 22, 2017 The EFF welcomes Zuma's appeal of the High Court Judgment that he must appoint the judge selected by the Chief Justice. We welcome this as his democratic right only taking solace in the fact that he will incur the legal costs personally. As long as he is not using taxpayers money to exhaust the legal options, his appeal must be welcomed.  It is obvious that the man has lost all capacity to feel shame. It is not only embarrassing that he is fighting to appoint a judge in a commission that will be investigating him. It is also a perfect sign that he wishes to undermine the inquiry itself by either delaying it or undermining it from a legal principles point of view. This is because a commission appointed by him when he is also to be investigated will be challenged as bias due to conflict of interest.  Since the problem Zuma is presenting is that a president must appoint the judge, he should just step down and allow a different president to do so.  We have confidence that the Supreme Court will embarrass him again and not only uphold the High Court judgement but also order him to pay cost from his own pocket.
