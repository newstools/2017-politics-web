SACP Free State welcomes election of new SACP Executive Mayor, Lindiwe Tshongwe and new political leadership collective for the Metsimaholo Municipality The South African Communist Party (SACP) welcomes the election of the political leadership collective of Metsimaholo Local Municipality at a Council sitting yesterday, 21 December 2017. The SACP congratulates comrade Lindiwe Tshongwe for being elected as Executive Mayor, the historic first under the emblem of the SACP in South Africa. We also congratulate comrade Thabo Mabasa and comrade Victor Nyembe for being elected Speaker and Council Whip, respectively.  The SACP is pleased that following rigorous consensus seeking consultation and discussions, there was convergence, in the best interest of the working class and community, to build a stable and functional municipality.  We call on the new leadership of the municipality to build a responsive, efficient and accountable municipality. We equally call on our communities to be active participants and contributors in building a Metsimaholo we want. The municipal leadership should strengthen and deepen ties with the community through ongoing democratic consensus-seeking consultation and delivery of services.  We wish the elected leadership collective all the best in their new responsibility and call on them to respond selflessly and with humility to the responsibility entrusted on them to serve the people wholeheartedly.  The SACP appreciates the support received during the elections and takes this opportunity to wish everyone a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year.  Statement issued by Bheke Stofile, SACP Free State Provincial Secretary, 22 December 2017
