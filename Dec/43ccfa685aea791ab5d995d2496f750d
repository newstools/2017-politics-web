ANC statement on Sate of Capture judgment 13 December 2017 The African National Congress welcomes the judgment of the North Gauteng High Court in relation to the Public Protector’s Remedial Action on the State of Capture Report; specifically the remedial action relating to the appointment of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry.  This judgment brings us a step closer to the implementation of the ANC NEC resolution which directed that the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into allegations of state capture be established without delay.  A Judicial Commission of Inquiry is our only recourse in verifying the very serious allegations of state capture which threaten the integrity of our democratically elected government.  The judicial commission of inquiry will provide everybody with an opportunity to tell their side of the story. We therefore trust President Jacob Zuma will act in accordance with this judgment without delay in the interest of our country.  Issued by Zizi Kodwa, Spokesperson, ANC, 13 December 2017
