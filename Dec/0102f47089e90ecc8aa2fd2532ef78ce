ANC resolves for immediate and unconditional downgrade of Israel Embassy The ANC’s National Conference, the highest decision making body of our organisation, has unanimously resolved to immediately and unconditionally downgrade the South African Embassy in Israel to a liaison office. The ANC resolution, adopted earlier today, reads: "In order to give our practical expression of support to the oppressed people of Palestine; the ANC has unanimously resolved to direct the SA government to immediately and unconditionally downgrade the South African Embassy in Israel to a Liaison Office." Delegates from the North West, together with branches and regions from other provinces, proudly championed this resolution. Indeed, coming to the conference we found unity in our solidarity with the Palestinians and support for such forms of sanctions against Israel.  The ANC in the North West will now join other provinces and structures in ensuring the speedy implementation of this resolution.  We concur with the PLO leader, General Jibril Rajoub, who was at our conference where explained that the downgrade of the SA Embassy in Israel will send a clear message to Israel that there is a price to pay for its human rights abuses and violations of international law. Forward with progressive internationalism! Statement issued by ANC North West Spokesperson, Gerald Modise, 20 December 2017
