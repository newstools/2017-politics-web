DA KZN: Speaker must probe ‘thuggery allegations’ against Finance MEC Belinda Scott 12 December 2017 The Democratic Alliance will today write to KwaZulu-Natal Legislature Speaker, Lydia Johnson to request an urgent investigation following serious allegations of unethical behaviour against provincial Finance MEC Belinda Scott. The claims form part of an affidavit by South African Grooms Association (SAGA) Chairman, Mr C.M Simoto which has been handed to the DA. According to the affidavit, Mr Simoto wrote to the KZN Gaming and Betting Board (KZNGBB) in November to raise concerns around Gold Circle’s licence renewal. The correspondence appears to have then been leaked to MEC Scott who then, according to the affidavit, contacted Mr Simoto instructing him to withdraw the letter and allegedly threatened him and his family. These allegations vindicate the DA’s ongoing concerns around MEC Scott and Gold Circle, while her supposed actions reflect poorly on the MEC’s judgement. Not only is she interfering, she is apparently also pursuing her own private agenda. Even more disturbing is how Mr Simoto’s letter ended up in the MEC’s hands and the claims of subsequent threats against him and his family. This is pure thuggery and if true cannot be accepted from any public representative, to say nothing of a member of the provincial executive. The DA expects the Speaker to treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves and to ensure that it is the subject of an immediate investigation. We are committed to monitoring the outcome of the probe and to ensuring that there are consequences in the event that the allegations are proved to be founded.
