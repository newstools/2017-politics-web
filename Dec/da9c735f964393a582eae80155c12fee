The people of Metsimaholo have voted for a new beginning On the 29 November 2017, the people of Metsimaholo rejected the corrupt ANC on the ballot paper. The ANC failed to reach the 50% needed in order to govern the municipality, with the ANC evidently being the only party that keeps declining in each and every election. This is a true reflection of what is going to happen in 2019; the death and burial of the ANC. The people of Metsimaholo are clearly tired of being used by the ANC and they have taken a stand, they have decided to vote differently. They voted for a new beginning. A new beginning that puts an end to the corrupt ways of the ANC. They voted against empty promises, poor service delivery, cadre deployment and a billing crisis. They have opted for a different government, a government that will govern with commitment, root out corruption, deliver basic services fairly and equitably. A government that will live up to its promises, starting with fixing the billing crisis in this municipality, bring about financial stability and deliver better services across Metsimaholo; more so to poor areas which were neglected by the previous ANC government. A government that will always make decisions that will be in the best interest of the people, and not to enrich a select few. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the DA in the Free State, to thank the people of Metsimaholo who voted for a new beginning by placing their trust in the DA, this alone is sign of courage because voting differently requires audacity. A new beginning has come for the people of Metsimaholo, where the DA will endeavour to reach every community member and ensure service delivery for all.
