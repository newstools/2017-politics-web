EFF condemns Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as apartheid Israel's capital city 7 December 2017 The EFF condemns the reactionary US President Donald Trump on his declaration recognising Jerusalem as the capital city of apartheid Israel. We join the international community in expressing disgust at this declaration which serves as ground for the total annihilation of Palestine and its people.  Trump has essentially given license to the project of illegally forced removals that have been taking place in East Jerusalem by Israel. His declaration is also in violation of international law and many UN resolutions regarding a two-state solution.  We call on the international community, in particular, the European Union, to reject Trump's pronouncement. Israel must be forced to end its illegal occupation of Palestine through boycotts, disinvestments and sanctions. The United Nations and the European Union must, as a reaction to Trump's declaration, impose immediate sanctions on apartheid Israel until it withdraws from the West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem.
