DA welcomes another judgement against Abrahams The Democratic Alliance congratulates Freedom Under Law on their victory in the North Gauteng High Court today. Once again the actions of Shaun Abrahams have been sharply called into question by our courts. Today's judgement, effectively setting aside the clearly irrational and expedient decision by Abrahams to withdraw fraud and perjury charges against Jiba, has demonstrated again that he is unfit for high office. The sooner he vacates that position, the sooner the work to reverse the capture of the NPA can begin. Unsurprisingly, the President has also once again been found wanting. Jiba and Mwrebi should now face the consequences of their actions and be held accountable for the damage they have wrought. This judgement again confirms that the judiciary will enforce the Constitution and the rule of law and that those who choose to flout these principles will be held to account. Statement issued by Glynnis Breytenbach MP, DA Shadow Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, 22 December 2017
