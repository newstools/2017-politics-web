NATIONAL TREASURY AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN REVENUE SERVICE RELEASE THE 10TH ANNUAL EDITION OF TAX STATISTICS PRETORIA, TUESDAY 12 DECEMBER 2017 – The National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service are pleased to announce the release of the 10th annual edition of the Tax Statistics today, on Tuesday 12 December 2017. The 2017 edition provides an overview of tax revenue collections and tax return information for the 2013 to 2016 tax years, as well as the 2012/13 to 2016/17 fiscal years. Accompanying the publication are detailed tables on revenue collection and data pertaining to all the major tax types for the past 10 years.  This provides data on the key trends of the past decade, and underlines the important role the tax system has played in contributing to South Africa’s fiscal health and socio-economic development. Revenue from personal income tax (PIT), as a percentage of total tax revenue, increased from 29.6% in 2007/08 to 37.2% in 2016/17 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%, and a proportion of 8.4% of GDP over this period. This robust performance allowed Government to offer large scale tax relief to all South Africans. This is despite the fact that the minimum tax thresholds for taxpayers below the age of 65 has increased from R40 000 in the 2007 tax year, to R73 650 in the 2016 tax year. Furthermore, for those who are 65 – 74 years, the minimum tax threshold increased from R65 000 to R114 800, and those who are 75 years and older the threshold increased from R104 261 in the 2012 tax year, when it was introduced, to R128 500. Also worth noting is the impact that tax reforms have had on the social mobility of South Africans since the advent of democracy. An illustrative graphic on page 34 of the Tax Statistics shows that a taxpayer earning taxable income of R100 000 in 1995 paid tax at a rate of 33.8%. The same taxpayer, with income adjusted for increases limited to inflation, in 2016 earned R344 653, but had an effective tax rate of 18.3%, providing more disposable income. The adjustment of income brackets and the minimum tax threshold for fiscal drag has resulted in reducing marginal tax rates for low and middle-income taxpayers. Measures to include the taxation of capital gains and taxing individuals on a residence basis on worldwide income have served to broaden the tax base, thus ensuring that the tax burden is spread more equitably.
