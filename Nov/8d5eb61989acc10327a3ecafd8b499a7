New mayor for Emfuleni Municipality after sex scandal Johannesburg – Emfuleni Local Municipality will officially inaugurate the ANC's Jacob Khawe as its new mayor, following a sex scandal involving its previous leader, Simon Mofokeng. Speaking to News24, Emfuleni mayoral spokesperson Lebo Mofokeng said the Emfuleni council had presided over Khawe’s appointment. She said he won in an outright majority, beating his DA counterpart councillor Edward von Bodenstein during the council sitting on Thursday. He took the victory with 53 votes to 15. "During council, he humbled himself before the community, saying he would first want to clean up the City. He said we should get out there and take to the streets of Emfuleni to help the people." When asked about the dismissal and processes around the former mayor, Mofokeng declined to comment. "We are not updated with his proceedings. I am not in a position to comment on that." The ANC Gauteng provincial executive committee last week welcomed the resignation of the previous mayor. His resignation came after the party placed him on special leave, following allegations of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl. News24
