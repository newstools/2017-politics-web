SCOPA orders SAPS and SITA to immediately terminate FDA contracts   30 November 2017 The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) has instructed the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) to terminate the multimillion-rand contracts with Forensic Data Analysis (FDA). On Wednesday SCOPA met with the management of SAPS, SITA and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) to discuss irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure at SAPS. The FDA contracts include the maintenance and technical support of the Firearms Permit Systems and the supply of forensic equipment to SAPS. R919,3 million has been paid to FDA since 2012. SCOPA Chairperson Mr Themba Godi said: “The position of the Committee is that the contracts with FDA are of a corrupt nature and we want to have them cancelled.” “For the first time in this Parliament, the person who is alleged in [connection to] irregular procurements came and sat throughout the meeting, Mr Keith Keating, without any hint of shame or embarrassment. We deplore and condemn that kind of stuff.” SCOPA also plans to engage IPID further and appreciates the work it has done in investigating corruption at SAPS, SCOPA has condemned reports of intimidation and threats directed at the SITA leadership, who are probing allegations of corrupt contracts at the SAPS, “We are encouraged that General Khehla Sitole, the new National Commissioner, seems to be the right man for the job. He has the right attitude and we believe that with the necessary support we can finally root out the cabal within the SAPS that is responsible for corruption,” said Mr Godi.
