If we do not self-correct, our significant gains will start to be eroded."We must be humble and listen to the people who elected us to lead," he said, including the counsel of the ANC's veterans.Private interests seeking to "capture and control" state organs, and the ANC itself, must be fought."An uncompromising fight against these destructive practices is a matter of strategic priority."The party needed to revamp its induction for members, to ensure the party was getting future leaders of integrity."We must not pay lip-service to organisational renewal."Without credible, honest, patriotic leadership, we will not achieve a national democratic society."ANC Western Cape acting chairperson Khaya Magaxa told News24 on Monday that Ramaphosa's speech was well received by the branches in attendance.The provincial ANC could not come to any resolutions on its policy positions yet, as they ran out of time this weekend.It will likely meet next weekend to finalise its positions ahead of the party's national conference starting on June 30.News24
