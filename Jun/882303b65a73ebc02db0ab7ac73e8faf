AfriForum brings PAIA application regarding fish species in Tsitsikamma National Park2 June 2017AfriForum brought an application in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000 (Act No.&nbsp;2 of 2000) (PAIA) against the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning regarding the decision of Edna Molewa, Minister of Environmental Affairs, to make 20% of the Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area (TMPA) accessible for fishery. This follows after the civil rights organisation already directed a letter to Molewa in February&nbsp;2017 regarding its concern about this decision.&nbsp; AfriForum would like to gain access to the following information: - The potential number of recreational fishers that will fish in this area; - A complete explanation of the decision to make the area accessible for recreational fishing, including scientific evidence of the impact it will have on the area;&nbsp; - The reason why various petitions opposing the opening of the TMPA were ignored; - The involvement of the Department in the decision-making process and if the possible impact on fishing communities residing in the area was taken into account; and - Considering the precedent created by this decision, how the Department will handle similar requests of communities bordering on the protected area. &ldquo;The Minister mentioned in her 2017 budget speech that the Department intends on implementing a national guideline for the establishment of coastal management lines and the protection of coastal areas. It is therefore unclear how she took her decision in December&nbsp;2016 to make the TMPA accessible for recreational fishery without any suchlike guidelines,&rdquo; says Chris Boshoff, AfriForum&rsquo;s Coordinator for Environmental Affairs.
