This initial allocation of R75 million is a first step in this process. We will continually reassess the needs and priorities going forward&rdquo;.Minister Ivan Meyer said: &ldquo;Our government is also grateful for the immense contribution from the private sector. The 4 major banks have made pledges, and DHL has so far delivered an enormous 284 tonnes of aid to Knysna. Generous support has also been provided by Pick n Pay, Spur, Clicks, Vodacom, Cell C and other corporates&rdquo;.The allocation of R75 million to assist with the recent disasters across the province was taken in terms of section 25 of the PFMA, which enables the Minister of Finance, Dr Ivan Meyer to authorise the use of funds from the Provincial Revenue Fund.

In addition, R15 million to support the Department to deal with the cost associated with the Swartland Hospital particularly for prefabricated units, replacement linen and technology.
