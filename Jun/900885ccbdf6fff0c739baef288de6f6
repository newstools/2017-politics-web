Misleading report in Sunday Times11 June 2017 The&nbsp;Sunday &nbsp; Times today,&nbsp;11 June 2017 , reported that the DA Western Cape legislature members had all, but one, signed a letter intended for the DA leader, Mr Maimane.For the record, no such letter exists. Secondly, it is a pity that the reporters in question had not contacted the DA caucus leadership before making such a claim as any dissention within the caucus ranks is not known to us and such claims would have been strongly refuted.&nbsp; Democratic Alliance Western Cape combined press release issued by Lorraine Botha, MPP and Mark Wiley, Chief Whip, 11 June 2017
