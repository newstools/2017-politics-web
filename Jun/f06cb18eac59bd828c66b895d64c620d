12-month deadline to reach 30% black mine ownership15 June 2017Cape Town &ndash; Mining companies will have 12 months to adhere to the new 30% black ownership requirement set out in the new Mining Charter that will be gazetted on Thursday, said Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.At a media briefing to explain the contents of the new Charter, Zwane said the new Mining Charter has pushed up the black ownership target from 26% to 30%, while mining prospecting rights will only be granted to companies that have a 50% plus one black ownership structure.&ldquo;The Charter is being gazetted this afternoon,&rdquo; Zwane said. &ldquo;The button has been pressed. There&rsquo;s no turning back. The success of this Charter to me is when we collectively get to a point where the minerals of the people in this country is shared among the people of South Africa,&rdquo; Zwane said.The Mines Minister said mining companies that already have a 26% black ownership structure will only be required to get an additional 4% to reach the 30% black ownership-target.&ldquo;Those who don&rsquo;t have 26% will need to empower from the current percentage up to 30%,&rdquo; Zwane said.The new charter will also not acknowledge historic empowerment deals and has given the mining sector a year to reach the new ownership target of 30% from 26%.During question time Zwane was asked about the ambitious new targets for black representation at board and management level of mining companies and whether there is indeed a pool of people in the industry who could be appointed to such positions.Zwane responded in the affirmative. &ldquo;Every year there are people who graduate, but some of them need to resort to car-washing because there are no jobs for them,&rdquo; Zwane said.The Minister said the new revised charter was as a result of wide consultation with some 60 stakeholders, including the Chamber of Mines, communities, workers, Cabinet ministers and the ruling party.&ldquo;We have done all we could do,&rdquo; Zwane said. &ldquo;No single one can have all its views reflected in the (new) charter. It&rsquo;s a charter where the people of South Africa have told us what to do &ndash; communities, traditional leaders, politicians and the Chamber of Mines.&rdquo;Zwane also took a swipe at parties who resort to the courts to find resolutions to matters they are unhappy with.&ldquo;This notion of (going to) courts has become a popular way of negotiating,&rdquo; he said, most likely in reference to the Chamber of Mines' mooted court action to get clarity on the once-empowered-always-empowered principle.Fin24
