SOUTH AFRICA MARKS 40 YEARS SINCE THE BRUTAL MURDER OF STEVE&nbsp;BIKO President Jacob Zuma has called on South Africans to remember, celebrate and preserve the legacy of Black Consciousness Movement leader, intellectual and liberation struggle hero, Mr Stephen Bantu&nbsp;Biko , who died in police custody as a result of police brutality on 12 September 1977, as the country marks the 40th&nbsp;anniversary of his passing. To mark this sad episode in the history of the South African struggle for liberation, President Jacob Zuma will visit Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre&nbsp;tomorrow &nbsp;and lay a wreath at the cell in which Mr&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;died. Mr&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;died in a police cell at the then Pretoria Central Prison (now Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre) following his arrest in August 1977. He had been savagely beaten by apartheid security police while in police detention in Port Elizabeth and sustained serious injuries including brain damage. He had been kept naked and chained and was not accorded any dignity. Failed by doctors who connived with the security police, he was transported to Pretoria from Port Elizabeth despite being seriously ill from the beatings. His death caused outrage locally and abroad. President Zuma said Steve&nbsp;Biko &rsquo;s leadership and ideals inspired not only South African liberation struggle activists in South Africa, but also many leaders and activists across the continent and the world who pursued an anti-racist, anti-colonial and anti-imperialist agenda. &ldquo;Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;fought white supremacy and was equally disturbed by what he saw as an inferiority complex amongst black people. He emphasized the need for psychological liberation for black people, to accompany physical liberation to undo the damage caused by apartheid. He advocated black pride and black self-reliance, believing that black people should be their own liberators and lead organisations fighting for freedom. He practiced what he preached with regards to self-reliance and led the establishment of several community projects which were aimed at improving the lives of the people.&nbsp; His ideals of self-reliance are more relevant than ever now as we push a radical socio-economic transformation agenda and the de-racialisation of the ownership, control and management of the economy,&rsquo;&rsquo; said President Zuma. Government continues to honour the memory and legacy of Mr&nbsp;Biko . Government dedicated this year&rsquo;s National Human Rights Day commemoration on 21 March 2017 to Steve&nbsp;Biko , acknowledging his contribution to the struggle for liberation and human rights for all in the country. The national commemoration was held in King William&rsquo;s Town and President Zuma unveiled the&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;grave site and memorial. Government, through the Department of Arts and Culture provided R130 million to the Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Foundation to develop the Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Centre, a national legacy project based in Ginsberg Township in Eastern Cape.&nbsp; The centre was officially launched on November 2012 and focuses on translating global interest in the legacy of MrBiko &nbsp;into a developmental resource for the region.&nbsp; The facility comprises a museum, an Archive and Library Resource Centre, a Commemorative Garden honouring Mr&nbsp;Biko , Cultural Performance and Production Spaces, a Community Media Centre and retail spaces. The Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Centre serves both as an intellectual resource while providing an economic opportunity for the region. Importantly, the centre features as the cornerstone of the&nbsp;Biko Heritage Trail, a series of&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;related sites in the Eastern Cape.&nbsp; These sites such as the&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Statue and&nbsp;Biko Bridge in East London, Zanempilo clinic,&nbsp;Biko &rsquo;s Home,&nbsp;Biko &rsquo;s Office,&nbsp;Biko &rsquo;s Grave and the Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Garden of Remembrance in King William&rsquo;s Town have been declared national heritage sites and consistently garner both local and international attention. Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;was a medical student at the University of Natal, where he was a student leader of distinction who was a founder of the South African Student Association (SASO). Due to his political activism he was expelled from the medical school and was later banned.&nbsp; In his honour, government through the Gauteng Department of Health, renamed the Pretoria Academic Hospital as Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Academic Hospital, in September 2008. It befits his memory that Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Academic Hospital is one of the well-managed public hospitals in the country, according to&nbsp;the reports of the Office of Health Standards Compliance which is the watchdog of the standard of health in this country. One of the main streets in Tshwane, Beatrix Street, where the hospital is also located, was also renamed as Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;Street. The world has also honoured&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;in many ways including a popular song&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;by British musician Peter Gabriel. The movie,&nbsp;Cry Freedom,&nbsp;based on a book by former editor Donald Woods, also attracted international acclaim. Said President Zuma; &ldquo;Steve&nbsp;Biko &nbsp;suffered great abuse, harassment and torture over a period of time and paid the supreme price for the liberation of black people from oppression and bondage. We shall always remember his sacrifice and contribution. We also thank the international community for honouring this great man and patriot in various ways,&rsquo;&rsquo; said President Zuma.
