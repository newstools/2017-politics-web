Transport MEC must account for KZN’s horrific road death toll over the long weekend 27 September 2017 The Democratic Alliance will today call for Transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda, to urgently appear before KwaZulu-Natal’s Transport portfolio committee to account for the province having the highest number of road-related deaths over the recent Heritage Day long weekend. According to Emergency Services, at least 21 people died on KZN roads as a result of multiple crashes while the country as a whole recorded 44 fatalities. The DA extends its condolences to the families that lost loved ones. We also pray for a speedy recovery for those who suffered injuries as a result of these crashes. Road safety is an issue that affects each and every citizen of our province. The high number of deaths in KZN is a clear indication that the provincial Department of Transport’s awareness campaigns are ineffective and must be urgently reviewed. The primary cause of most crashes is reckless driving, speeding, driving under influence of alcohol and unroadworthy vehicles, amongst other things. To date, the DoT’s standard response to this is to increase visibility over holiday periods. Clearly this is not having the desired effect and law enforcement initiatives need to run consistently throughout the year. This inadequate measure is compounded by the lack of consequences for drivers who show total disregard for the rules of the road and relevant traffic regulations. The DA is committed to ensuring that MEC Kaunda and his Department review their current strategy. Until such time as the DoT commits to change, innocent people will continue to lose their lives.
