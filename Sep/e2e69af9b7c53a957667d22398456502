ANC turns its back on residents by collapsing Council 27 September 2017 Today, the ANC in Johannesburg showed its disdain for residents by deliberately collapsing the City’s Council sitting and staging a walkout which prevented the deliberation of crucial items needed to drive service delivery. The ANC refused to deliberate an item on the agenda relating to the implementation of public consultations on the upcoming 2018/19 Integrated Development Plan (IDP). The IDP public consultations are an extensive public engagement aimed at ensuring that the City’s spending and priorities best reflects our residents’ needs and act as the primary tool guiding the delivery of services within the City. Instead of engaging the Council on how this process should be carried out for the benefits of residents across the City, particularly the poor, the ANC turned their backs on residents and left the Council. This is nothing more than the ANC attempting to desperately grasp what the Courts denied them during their frivolous court application which ended last night; access to the City so they can continue their tradition of corruption and the looting of resources. Last night the South Gauteng High Court held that the urgent application lodged by the ANC to table a motion of no confidence against the Speaker and myself, by secret ballot, during today’s Council sitting lacked the urgency which they attempted to fabricate into existence. The Court, correctly, struck the application from the roll and awarded punitive costs in favour of the City. It is clear that the ANC will stop at nothing, including wasting the time and money of the Court’s and Council to re-establish their network of corruption and patronage in the City of Johannesburg.
