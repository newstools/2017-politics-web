Military explosives recovered by JMPD K9 Unit 7 September 2017 Yesterday, 6 September, the City’s Police Department (JMPD) K9 Unit apprehended two suspects at Robertsham, south of Johannesburg in a joint operation with the Crime Intelligence (CIU). The CIU received information about a vehicle carrying explosives and asked JMPD K9 to intercept the vehicle. JMPD K9 acted swiftly and arrested a male and a female suspect. On further investigations, it was discovered that there were three live mortar bombs hidden at the back of a Gauteng Enterprise Propeller branded vehicle. The vehicle is believed to be owned by the Gauteng Provincial government, whether the suspects are government employees is also being investigated. Mortar bombs are often used by cash-in-transit heists as well as ATM bombing crimes. It is reported that the mortar bombs could be sold for up to R450 000 if they were to fall into the wrong hands. Both suspects are detained at the Booysens Police Station to face serious criminal charges. MMC of Public Safety, Councillor Michael Sun emphasised his position on zero tolerance for lawlessness in the City of Johannesburg “We will not make any room for criminals in our City, the quick reaction by JMPD is evidence of how serious we are about eradication of crime in our City. We will continue to enhance the synergy amongst all law enforcement agencies and ensure that criminals are sent packing to prisons”.
