Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has never accepted nor attended any event of the Gupta family19 September 2017Following a number of media queries, the Office of the Minister for Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu would like to place it on record that she has never accepted nor attended any event of the Gupta family.The so called &ldquo;Gupta Leaks&rdquo; email doing rounds in the social media purporting that Minister was amongst the list of people who accepted some form of invite by the Gupta family in February 2015 is regrettable and should be dismissed with the contempt it deserves.All invites the Minister receives are kept in registry and every acceptance would reflect on the programme whose copies are all filed for safe keeping.Whoever is behind this smear campaign against the Minister, for obvious reasons, is urged to desist from doing so immediately.Issued by Vusi Tshose, Ministerial Spokesperson, Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu, 19 September 2017 &nbsp;
