EFF calls for immediate removal of Dudu Myeni from SAA Board4 September 2017The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) notes that Ms Duduzile Cynthia Myeni says she will stay at South African Airways (SAA) as the Chairperson of the Board as long as Mr Jacob Zuma is a President. Ms Myeni stay as the Chairperson of SAA is subject to approval and resolution of Cabinet. Existing Cabinet resolution says Ms Myeni term of office, as Chairperson of SAA, is finished.On the 31st of August 2016, Cabinet approved the appointment of SAA new board including the reappointment of Ms Duduzile Cynthia Myeni as the Chairperson of the Board. On the 2nd&nbsp;of September 2016, Presidency issued a statement, which indicated that &ldquo;Ms Duduzile Cynthia Myeni, the current Chairperson of the Board of SAA, has been reappointed for a period of one year&rdquo;. Therefore, effective from the 31st&nbsp;of August 2017, Ms, Myeni ceased to be a member and Chairperson of the Board and as such must be removed.Ms Myeni's continued stay at SAA would lead to further financial crisis and instability of the airline because moneylenders don&rsquo;t trust her and will continue to withdraw the rollover on loan repayments. As a result, the situation will lead to irrational decisions like disposal of government stake at Telkom to bailout SAA.&nbsp;The EFF wrote a letter to the Minister of Finance Mr Malusi Gigaba to demand the effective removal of Ms Myeni from SAA Board with immediate effect to ensure stabilization of SAA and get the national carrier on a path to recovery and stability. We called on the Minister to attend to this matter with the urgency it deserves to assist all efforts to ensure SAA continue to contribute meaningfully to South Africa&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp;Issued by&nbsp;Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi &nbsp;, Spokesperson,&nbsp;the Economic Freedom Fighters,&nbsp;4 September 2017
