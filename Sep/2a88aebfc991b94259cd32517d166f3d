Motshekga must put learners first during Sadtu strike The DA will call on the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to ensure that learners are safe and that their educational needs are put first by liaising with the police ahead of Wednesday’s strike by the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu). Learners must come forward on Wednesday if they are in any way threatened, injured or attacked and the DA will assist them in laying charges against Sadtu and hold the Minister to account for inaction. Many teachers are hardworking and deplore violence but often Sadtu harasses learners and non-striking members during its protests and they cannot continue to threaten the constitutionally enshrined rights of learners to education and safety. Motshekga must ensure that there are contingency plans put in place, especially since matric exams start very soon and learning should not be hindered at this time. These final exams are vital to learners’ post-school futures and disrupting them would be irresponsible and unfair. Strikes in the education sector have for too long compromised the safety and well-being of our children and it is for this reason the DA intends to have the posts of principals, their deputies and other critical staff members at schools declared essential services. The DA believes in the right to strike, but we cannot condone violent behaviour and intimidation. Motshekga must choose to either put the needs of children first as Minister or stand with the disruptive Sadtu, which clearly does not care about the future of our children. Teachers should develop our children and support them in building their lives, not destroying them, and it is Motshekga’s responsibility to ensure our children’s futures are not compromised by strike action.
