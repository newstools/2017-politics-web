ANC Councillors abandon their duties and waste money because of ‘joke’ 7 September 2017 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini will today be writing to the City Manager, Sipho Nzuza, asking him how much money was wasted today at the Community Service workshop where ANC councillors chose to walk out and abandon the meeting. The DA was shocked to see the Chairperson of the Committee, Zama Sokhabase, leading a walk-out of this important workshop aimed at tackling the issue of safety within City Parks. An error in one if the presentations lead to a comment by an official that “they can’t pronounce large numerical amounts like President Jacob Zuma”. This comment, that was meant as a “joke”, lead to ANC councillors abandoning their civil duties by disrupting the meeting and walking out. It is disappointing when people in leadership positions behave this irresponsibly.  The official apologised for the mistake and withdrew it, but this did not appease the ANC who continued with their action. Nzuza should determine how much money was wasted by this walkout. Those who neglected their civil duty today to discuss matters that concern people’s security, must be held accountable and pay back the money.
