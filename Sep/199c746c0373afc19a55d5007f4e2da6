Could alleged bodyguard footage be the ‘smoking gun’ in ANC killings? 7 September 2017 The Democratic Alliance is alarmed at the recently-released footage of men who are apparently the bodyguards of the ANC eThekwini Regional Secretary, Bheki Ntuli. In the short video, the men are seen cocking guns and making threatening remarks like “today we are going to kill this dog”, clearly referring to an individual. One of the guns is an AK47, which is banned and illegal to own in South Africa. Could this video be the "smoking gun" that will finally link ANC officials to politically motivated killings in KwaZulu-Natal? We call on the ANC in the province to determine whether these men are indeed Ntuli's protectors and, if so, to explain why they have an illegal firearm that they apparently use to make threats with? It is important that the date that this video was filmed is also established in case it can be linked it to previous killings that have taken place. It is now more important than ever before that the Provincial Chairperson of the ANC, Sihle Zikalala, confirm a time and date that he will appear before the Moerane commission of inquiry. I wrote to Zikalala on the 30th of August 2017 requesting these details. He has steadfast refused to do so. The ANC can no longer keep quiet about these political murders that take place within their own ranks. The time for the ANC to find its voice is now, we simply can’t wait another day longer.
