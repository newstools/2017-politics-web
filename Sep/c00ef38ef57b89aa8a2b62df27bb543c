PMB Court’s ruling confirms ANC cannot be trusted 12 September 2017 Today’s ruling by the Pietermaritzburg High Court that the results of the KwaZulu-Natal ANC's 8th provincial elective conference in November 2015 were unlawful,  once again proves that the ANC cannot be trusted. The governing party has completely lost its moral foundation and is not reliable to run the government of this province, let alone the country. The subsequent hasty provincial cabinet reshuffle was clearly made by those who wanted to get their hands on public funds. Today KZN voters have seen the ANC for what it is - a party with people who are greedy for positions. A party that is like a snake eating its own tail, divided and fractured and focused on internal battles and access to public money rather than on delivery to the people of KwaZulu-Natal. Come 2019, the people of KwaZulu-Natal will have a chance to vote for clean governance, with honest and trustworthy leaders that will focus on service delivery for all.
