EFF will not meet the DA 2 September 2017 The EFF will not meet the DA to discuss its decision to stayaway from councils led by the DA. We are not in any coalition with the DA and we do not owe the DA any explanation whatsoever. The EFF will never explain itself to a white man. The very tone and choice of words express in the DA statement demonstrate the supremacist attitude we have been talking about all along. To refer to our decision as "short sighted" is proof of arrogance, always portraying their point of view as superior. The EFF is well aware of the 2016 election outcome in which our people rejected the ANC. The truth however is that this did not translate into the DA being the choice. To operate with an assumption that a rejection of the ANC is an embrace of DA is foolish if at the end of the day you did not win elections. The EFF reiterates that it is not part of any coalition government and it does not owe anyone any explanation. We rejected being in government with the DA precisely because in our view, not only are our policies opposed to each other, but also because they are arrogant and a permanent house of white supremacists.
