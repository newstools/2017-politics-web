Others charged included Zwane and suspended Eskom CFO Anoj Singh.OUTA chair Wayne Duvenage said the latest information from the Hawks made the organisation feel positive."People often say 'why do we waste our time when nothing happens?' &ndash; we know one day the police and Hawks will do something," Duvenage said."We are relieved and very happy &ndash; we hope this [investigation] will not suffer [from] political meddling."News24
