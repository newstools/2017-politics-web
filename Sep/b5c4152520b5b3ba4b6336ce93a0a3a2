DA calls on ANC in KZN to end systemic factionalism and put the people first18 September 2017The Democratic Alliance today calls on the collective ANC leadership in KwaZulu-Natal and the National Executive Committee to end the systemic factionalism within the province and start putting the people first.Our call follows recent events within the ANC which come as a result of two conflicting centres of power &ndash; a situation with all the ingredients necessary to throw this province into chaos.Adding fuel to the fire is the recent court finding that the current ANC leadership is illegal, along with calls from former Premier Senzo Mchunu&rsquo;s camp for the current leadership under Sihle Zikalala to vacate their office &ndash; a move which has taken party divisions a step further as Zikalala&rsquo;s camp ignores the ANC NEC while unilaterally announcing that an appeal will be lodged against the court.The DA regards this ongoing factionalism as a threat to the legislature and its responsibilities of governance and oversight.&nbsp; We have already witnessed the indefinite postponement of legislature sittings and committees not sitting as a result of being inquorate. This is unacceptable.These conditions in an already volatile province have the makings of a disaster waiting to happen. For the ANC to even suggest that it is little more than a domestic dispute is yet further proof of an organisation out of touch with reality and which is distancing itself from the people.The current arrogance and lack of leadership within the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal will come back to bite them in the 2019 elections with the further demise of voter support.The factionalism within the ANC diverts the party from its real mandate, namely to represent the people of this province and to ensure that they receive the services that they deserve.Issued by&nbsp;Francois Rodgers,&nbsp;Leader of the DA in the KZN Legislature, 18 September 2017&nbsp;
