Gauteng ANC has no bite 27 September 2017 The participation of the Gauteng ANC in today’s COSATU-led march against state capture is a farce that seeks only to score political points and has nothing to do with resolving the unrelenting looting of state coffers. If the ANC in Gauteng truly had the gusto to condemn state capture outright, it would call for the resignation of President Jacob Zuma who has been found to be wanting by the highest court in the land. His close links to the Gupta family, and the scandals around kick-backs to his family and friends, places him at the epicenter of this nefarious web. While the leadership of the ANC in Gauteng have not yet placed their cards on the table about who they will back in December’s elective conference, there is clear indication already that with or without President Zuma, the status quo is set to remain. The ANC cannot and will not self-correct. Come 2019, residents of Gauteng and citizens across South Africa will have the opportunity to take action against those who have abused the freedoms that so many suffered to achieve. They will vote for the DA. In 2019, the Gauteng ANC will be remembered for being on the wrong side of history. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 27 September 2017
