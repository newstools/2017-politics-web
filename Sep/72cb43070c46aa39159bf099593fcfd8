Mantashe warns against factionalism18 September 2017Cape Town &ndash; &ldquo;The primary enemy of the ANC is the askari-impulse within its leadership,&rdquo; ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe said on Sunday afternoon in Nyanga.Mantashe was participating in a mini-rally at the Oscar Mphetha High School ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s by-election in Cape Town&rsquo;s ward 37, in which Luyanda Nyingwa will represent the ANC.Mantashe was concerned about the &ldquo;temptation to implode the ANC from within&rdquo; and said those who want to do that &ldquo;collude with the same forces that would have liked to see Nelson Mandela die in prison&rdquo;.Among the audience of about 200 people, there were a few with the letters NDZ &ndash; the moniker for one of the ANC presidential hopefuls Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma &ndash; emblazoned on their ANC attire, while there were also a few T-shirts sporting Lindiwe Sisulu's &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a must!&rdquo; campaign slogan. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any animosity among those flying different banners.&ldquo;With the divisive T-shirts, you are pledging your loyalty to an individual, not the ANC. You need to pledge loyalty to ANC, not individuals,&rdquo; Mantashe said.He warned against a cult of personality in the organisation.&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be loyal to an individual, you&rsquo;re loyal to the ANC.&rdquo;He said factions discuss individuals, not programmes.He said after December&rsquo;s elective conference society should be able to say the ANC is serious. He said the focus shouldn&rsquo;t be on individuals, but on rejuvenating the ANC&rsquo;s reputation.Mantashe also impressed on the audience to keep their ward councillors accountable.Rapturous welcome for ANC SG @GwedeMantashe1 in Nyanga @News24 pic.twitter.com/zyCTNP35Lc&mdash; Jan Gerber (@gerbjan) September 17, 2017News24
