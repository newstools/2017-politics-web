DA remains committed to serving the people of NMB Reports today about the possibility of an election in Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) where a DA-led coalition has been in government, seeks to distract us from the most pertinent issues. The reality is that the people of NMB rejected the ANC at the ballot box during the 2016 Local Government Elections. They made it clear, through their vote, that they wanted total change. They gave the DA and our coalition partners the mandate to govern with the commitment to root out corruption, deliver basic services fairly and equitably. The coalition government has already made great progress in rooting out corruption, bringing about financial stability and delivering services across NMB, more so to poor areas which were neglected by the previous ANC government. We cannot seek to put those very same voters through an election when their voices have been heard loud and clear, not just in NMB but in Tshwane and The City of Johannesburg. We also cannot be held to ransom and be forced to make decisions which will not be in the best interest of the people that we serve. The DA remains committed to working with all our partners to ensure that we do fail those who have entrusted us with a mandate to lead them to a corrupt-free and working city. We will continue to engage further with those whom we govern with so that we can ensure that we do lose sight of what is most important, the voters.
